Place logo images here to use official brand marks where available.

Expected filenames currently referenced in code:
- langchain.png
- langgraph.png

Recommended sizes: square 64–128 px PNG with transparent background. Larger images will be auto-fitted to 28px in the Skills grid.

Note: Most other logos (Python, Java, JavaScript, MongoDB, Git) are rendered via the Devicon CDN and don’t require local files.
